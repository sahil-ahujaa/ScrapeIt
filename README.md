# ScrapeIt
## Simple web scrapers in NodeJS
### Web scraping (web harvesting or web data extraction) is data scraping used for extracting data from websites. While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a bot or web crawler. It is a form of copying, in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or analysis.
